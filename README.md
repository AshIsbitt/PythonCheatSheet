# Python Cheat Sheet

This is a python cheat sheet put together by following the video "[[Python Programming]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4mEzFDjqtA)" by Derek Banas of NewThinkTank. The purpose of this was to refresh myself on the basics of python as it's been a few years since I used the language. I would recommend the video if you are already familiar with programming concepts or have used other programming languages before and are looking to pick up Python3 quickly, or to refresh rusty skills on python if you haven't touched the language in a while.

It is worth noting that this video is dated from 2014 and there is one small part at the end of the video that no longer works identically. To fix this, I called attributes from a parent class in the child class as so:

	self._Animal__name
(See line 357 of PythonCheatSheet.py))

This also follows the [Pygame in 90 Minutes - For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO6qQDNa2UY) video by TechWithTim, which I used as a first introduction to Pygame and found the video useful and informative, covering a number of elements I had not seen before
